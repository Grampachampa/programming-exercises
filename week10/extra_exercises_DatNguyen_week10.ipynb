    "## Social bot by an underpaid developer\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh, its you again, the underpaid employee that made the abomination of *spam-or-ham* classifier; seems like you weren't fired after that Σ(°ロ°). Now, as you are still of use to the company, the boss tells you to write a bot that can **\"recognize and remember to make personalized interactions, while also having some human-like elements\"**. Since you are still being \\*cough\\* legally \\*cough\\* paid minimum wage (seriously, why don't you just quit), you decided to make something that is considered *good enough*. This bot should:\n",
    "- Ask for name of the current user.\n",
    "- Ask if the current user wants to add more facts about themselves, or if they would like to hear facts that the robot remembers.\n",
    "- The bot should store facts about people inside of a dictionary, with keys being the name, and values being lists of facts (as strings).\n",
    "- The human-like element would be that the bot is forgetful: after every interactions, there is a 0.05 chance that the bot would either forget, or mistake a fact of someone with that of another person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description and optional steps:\n",
    "* Create a class Bot\n",
    "* In the **\\__init\\__**, the bot should initiate a dictionary as its memory\n",
    "* Create a method called **update_mem()** that takes a string as an arguement, and update the dictionary if prompted.\n",
    "* Create a method called **inquire_name()** that does not take anything as arguments, but returns a string.\n",
    "* Create a method called **get_fact()** that does not take anything as arguments, but returns a string.\n",
    "* Create a method called **forget()** that does not take anything as arguments, but change the dictionary's content in someway (human-like element), this method should be called after each update_mem().\n",
    "* Create a method called **step()** that would prompt the bot to go to the next step in the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "You can use the module **random** to generete pseudo-random numbers/probabilities/choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also handle all exceptions that you can think of (value error, e.t.c); you don't have to consider all of them, just think of this as practicing for future projects.\n",
