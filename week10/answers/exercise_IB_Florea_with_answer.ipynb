Define the attributes id, name, courses_final_grades. id is a unique student number, name should be the name of the student and courses_final_grades a dictionary where the keys are the courses taken by the student and the values are the final grades. Create a list of three instances of the class Student where each student takes the same three courses. Find the course for which the average of all student grades for that course is the highest.\n",
