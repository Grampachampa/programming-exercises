    "In a new theme park, only people who are at least 12 years old are allowed to enter as some of the rides are considered to be too extreme for little children. At the entrance gate, the theme park staff checks the ages of every member of the families about to enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a small program that could be used to help the staff at the entrance. The program should ask for a list of ages and print for each one a message \"You may enter, have fun!\" if the age is above the threshold, or a message \"Please come back later.\" if it is not. After printing the messages, the function should ask for a new list of ages, so that it can quickly be re-used for families arriving one after the other at the theme park gate. The process should repeat until the input \"stop\" is given instead of a list of ages.\n",
