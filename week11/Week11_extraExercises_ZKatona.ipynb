    "# Book quiz 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A new quiz game on writers and books is under development. For this game, a class called Author is created. An object in the Author class represents a writer and has the following attributes: name, active years and writing language. The class can be seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the active years attribute is currently stored in the form of a string (e.g., `\"1929-1976\"`). You will have two tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a new method to the Author class called `getYears`, which will return the boundaries of the author's active years in a tuple (e.g., `(1929, 1976)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add another method to the Author class called `careerLength`, which returns the number of years in which the author was active (e.g., `47` for an author who was active between 1929 and 1976). After adding this method, use it to print the number of active years for the example author given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you should reuse the `getYears` method inside the `careerLength` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "author = Author(\"John Steinbeck\", \"1929-1976\", \"US English\")\n",
