Train-Spam
Phishing works by tricking people into giving up their sensitive information, but pharming tricks computers by changing Domain Name System (DNS) settings on a router. When you type in a website address your computer goes through several DNS servers before finding the correct IP address to direct you to the correct site. A DNS server is basically a system that points your computer in the right direction so when you type in an address, it can direct your computer to the right website. If someone poisons the DNS servers and redirects it to a fake site, you can fall victim to pharming. The criminal then gets access to all of the information you enter on that site.
