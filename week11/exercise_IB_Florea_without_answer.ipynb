Define the attributes id, name, courses_final_grades. id is a unique student number, name should be the name of the student and courses_final_grades a dictionary where the keys are the courses taken by the student and the values are the final grades. Create a list of three instances of the class Student where each student takes the same three courses. Use a dictionary to order the courses in descending order by the average grade for that course.\n",
