Specifically, create animal instances that are of class \"Animal\" with attributes name, and type, then add all those instances to a list. At the end, print the animals and their classification in the form \"animal name - classification\". Since it is a note, it has all kinds of irrelevant scribblings, therefore you would need to take a look at it and extract only useful information.\n",
